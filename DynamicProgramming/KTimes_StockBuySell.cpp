/* here the question is you have to find the max profit tht can be done, if you have the option to buy and sell stocks K at most k times
 now if this was to be done for k=1 time, then problem becomes find local minima and maxima at every point and at whatever day there maximum diff between local minima and maxima is the max profit that can be achived
 local minima is minimim at i from 0 to i and local maxima is maximum at i from i to end

 now here this approach cant wokr i.e. greedy solution doesnt work

 we have xexplore each and every option to get maximum profit so DP comes into picture

// now here the state is transaction i.e. k and day
// final state is when transaction becomes k DP[k][N]
// element of choice here at every point is
// 1. to not sell at that day i, i.e. DP[T][d-1] //by not selling at that day you will get max profit equal to last day's profit as nothing has changed
//2. sell at that particular day
// now to sell you need to buy it before the day d, so you have 0 to d-1 days options to buy the sell
// now we need to maximize the profit so from all the options you will have to chose the one which gives
//maximum profit
// if you sell at day d, price[d] - price[m] + DP[T][m]
//here if you sell at day d, sp you get price[d]-price[m] profit for the current transaction
// and also whatever max profit was there before in the earlier transaction so DP[t-1][m]
//t-1 denotes previous transaction's max profit
